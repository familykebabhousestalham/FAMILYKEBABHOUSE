Here’s a different, CSS-first approach that works on any mobile (no more fiddling with scroll margins or JS offsets). We’ll turn your sticky nav into a truly fixed header, then simply pad your content underneath so it never gets covered.

1) Convert your nav wrapper to fixed In client/src/pages/menu.tsx, find:

jsx
{/* Category Navigation */}
<div className="sticky top-0 z-40 bg-white shadow-lg py-4">
  …your buttons…
</div>
and replace it with:

jsx
{/* Category Navigation */}
<div className="fixed top-0 inset-x-0 z-40 bg-white shadow-lg h-16 sm:h-20 flex items-center">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-6">
    {/* …your buttons… */}
  </div>
</div>
• fixed top-0 inset-x-0 pins it to the very top across the full width. • h-16 sm:h-20 gives it a consistent height (4rem on phones, 5rem on tablets+). • Keep your z-40 so it sits above all content.

2) Pad all the page content below the nav Wrap your menu content in a padding container that matches the header height. Immediately after the </div> above, insert:

jsx
{/* Push page content below fixed nav */}
<div className="pt-16 sm:pt-20">
  {/* Everything else (header, special offers, menu-content section, voice controls…) */}
</div>
That ensures on mobile you always have 4rem of blank space at top, and on desktop 5rem. Your dishes will slide into view underneath, never behind.

3) Remove all scroll-margin / scroll-padding / JS-scroll hacks

Delete any style={{ scrollMarginTop: … }} or Tailwind scroll-mt-… on #menu-content.

Remove the useEffect calling scrollIntoView.

Remove global html { scroll-padding-top } rules if you like (they’re no longer needed).

After that diff:

• Your nav is permanently fixed at the top. • All content is padded down by the exact same height—no overlap ever. • You can now scrap any JS-scroll logic you’d been chasing.

Give it a rebuild on your phone; the dishes will always appear fully visible beneath the category bar.
